title: Going hard equals fruitful career or Why Marcus Aurelius would've made a great coder

Doing hard things is what drives the human brain. Challenge. This is also what
keeps us in the so called `flow` state. The state in which you're being your best
self. In which you produce as much as possibly can, both in terms of quality
and in terms of quantity.

You get better at doing the hard things through experience but also through
voluntary discomfort, and this is where the stoics come in. Back in the days of
Ancient Rome, stoics would put themselves voluntarily through discomfort, both
physical and mental in order to strengthen their minds and bodies. This was
because they believed that in order to have a good and meaningful life, you would
need to overcome your insatiability and dive into deep, hard work. In todays
standards this discomfort would equivalate to climbing the stairs instead of
taking the elevator, walking to the office instead of taking the car or even
disabling coding assistants in your IDE.

<h3>How to implement voluntary discomfort as a dev</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        when tasks are assigned, try and get the ones that you have absolutely 
        no idea what they mean - these are best for growth - if they exist, 
        otherwise default to most difficult
    </li>
    <li>
        when there needs to be something done in a different project / with a 
        different tech stack and you're asked if you can do it, just do it
    </li>
    <li>
        from time to time, learn and do the thing instead of using a thing that 
        does the thing, or using a thing that uses the thing that does the thing,
        or... you got the point
    </li>
    <li>
        if you program outside of your working hours, use something different 
        than what you use at work (unless you need to ship fast and this would 
        make you much slower)
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Minimalism</h3>
Your ability to go deep and hard into problems is highly impacted by the ease 
of use of your tools and the amount of distractions in your environment. Romans 
were adepts of minimalism to allow them to focus on the important problems in 
life (well, that was until they started throwing parties where they would fill 
themselves with food and drink, tickle their throats with goose feathers to 
throw everything up, get back to eating and drinking and repeat this until they 
got bored).

The moral of the story is you should aim to have such tools as to allow yourself
to focus on the difficult things. Once decided on them, you should focus on
learning them by heart, master them. When you're searching files visually on
the directory overview in vscode you're doing something wrong. Now, I'm not
going to tell you what to use, but you should use Linux, i3, tmux and vim for
the absolute least overhead and most minimal set of screwdrivers. Or, if you
want to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/manual/ed_manual.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ed</a>,
like the rockstars from ancient times, I can only bow to that.
Also, eat and drink in moderation (because it ain't that easy to come by goose
feathers nowadays, unless you're living in rural areas, in which case you're
fine, knock yourself out).

<h3>Why LLMs might not be that good for your health</h3>
The stair problem: you deliver pizza to the door in a big city. You have the 
choice of taking the elevator or climbing the stairs. What do you choose? If 
you take the elevator you will get to the twentieth floor faster than getting 
the stairs, but is that really better? It depends. You are of course, delivering
it much faster, at least in the short term. Your competitor might be way slower 
in the beginning months, but he will catch up because doing the hard thing will 
shape him. And when there's a new block in town that hasn't got it's elevator 
set up yet, will you honour orders to any of the people living there? What about
your health? your competitor will be fit and in great shape while you'd get to 
become a potato. Don't become a potato!

The rally driver & co-driver problem: In order to drive real fast on difficult
tracks whilst minimizing chances of crashing there has to be a strong
relationship based on trust between the driver and co driver. Also, the
co-drivers instructions must be as clear and precise as possible. Will you get
on the wheel if your co-driver is hallucinating from too much LSD?

To be clear, I'm not saying that LLMs aren't a useful tool, I'm just advocating
for moderation and constant exposure to voluntary discomfort that would keep us
in shape. Not to forget also that Microsoft is behind almost all of this.
Everyone knows me and my homies sincerely, <i>`truly`</i> like Microsoft.

<h3>Proper environment</h3>
Apart from the minimalist tools, the voluntary discomfort and a sincere 
dedication to hard work, the environment is a big part of who we are, how we 
make decissions and most likely a clear indication of who we will be in the 
future. This, like many things in life, is predetermined. You don't get to 
choose it. You kind of do a force landing into existence and hope to land in a
decent spot. Myself, I was lucky enough to land in such a spot and for that I am
grateful. I am grateful for having a supporting family, great friends that I can
count on, a highly skilled team at work and inspiring figures (Prime).

Ok, enough writing. Back to feasting.
